Hello, this is Crappyâ€™s Blog as usual. I wrote this blog to say that I have moved from Cloudflare to another DNS provider now.

### Why?

Mainly, useless for my position and part of my **de-cloudflare** project

### New Provider

1984.is FreeDNS,

My only criteria is support for DNSSEC.

Unfortunately, my registrar doesn't support it yet and I've had problems adding multiple MX Records to the same domain in desec so I moved to 1984 FreeDNS. This decision might be forever or until i find another great provider.

### Moving of Landing Page Builder

Actually, I moved from Cloudflare Pages to Surge. But, they don't yet support IPV6 and their certificate provision seems a bit confusing, so I moved to Netlify instead.
