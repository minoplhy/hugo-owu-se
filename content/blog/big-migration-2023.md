<b>Happy New Year, 2023!</b> Well, it's a little too late, though. It's been June now. and that brings back a memory of something that I've totally forgotten all the time since New Year's Day. 

One registry had increased their price by 100%, if my calculation is correct. 1w1.one was $7.99 at Namesilo until November last year. Since then, the price for renewal has been $15.99. which is ok, but I just don't want to continue with this price, so I decided to move on.

Just changing the domain doesn't satisfy me enough, so I decided to move on from the old punk theme, which is ugly as fuck, to the [Jekyll-Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) theme, which is much cleaner and easier to modify than my old theme.

# waii.ch?

Why waii.ch, though? You may ask. Even, myself can't answer that question. Maybe because I'm just getting older and start hating domains with numbers in them.

# Phasing out

If you're seeing this message, then it's the right time to say that the phasing out of "1w1.one" has already begun. All e-mail addresses associated with "1w1.one" will slowly be replaced by "3qx.nl," which is my main e-mail domain. PGP keys will still be the same. 

Other than that, they aren't significant enough to be specified here, except for the Gitea redirection saga, which transitions from `"schemmegit.1w1.one" -> "1w1.one/schemmegit" -> "1w1.one/src" -> "waii.ch/p-p"`. which will be problematic after "1w1.one" expires at the end of 2024. 

I advised everyone and myself to change the Gitea repository remote to the latest one as fast as possible.

<b>The phasing out is expected to be successful by around the end of 2023, or it can be much sooner. depends on my free time.</b>
