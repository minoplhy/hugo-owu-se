There're always moments in your life where lots of shit start to breakeven at the same times, Last week i have lost access to my home server entirely either via Network or via Monitor(cause i didn't have one sadly). 

In this blog, we'll drive into a journey of a lifetime where i attempting to recover access to my server via SSH without having Monitor cause i ain't gonna pay for it

# Server-Router-PC Ethernet Connection

Ok First, What to do? I'll try **ethernet to the router then `nmap` from my PC to find hosts** that's up. **Theoretically this should work in most case**, since your Router should give **local IP Address via DHCP** or **static IP Address is set on the right subnet**

![Router 1](/images/blog/no-network-monitor-no-problem/router1.webp)

Now with everything connected, we’ll try to find hosts that’s up in the LAN network range with `nmap`

In this example, LAN IP Address range is `10.10.20.0/24`

{{< code_expand >}}
nmap -sn 10.10.20.0/24
{{< /code_expand >}}


![NMAP](/images/blog/no-network-monitor-no-problem/nmap.webp)

hmm, Sadly didn't work :<

From this, there's is a possible cause that

* Server doesn't configure DHCP
    * by looking at `/etc/network/interfaces` -> `iface eth0 inet dhcp` should look like this

But since i didn't have access to my server, I assumed that this meant server's network configuration is probably shitbed rn

We'll look into on a more **Nerdies** side on the next section

# Server-PC Ethernet Connection

Since the old school Server-Router-PC methods doesn't work on me, we'll look into on a more advanced methods, which is directly connect 
**Server ↔ PC via ethernet** like the graph below

![Connection Graph](/images/blog/no-network-monitor-no-problem/connection_graph.webp)


## Static

Before we do anything else, start up a packet collection on your PC with WireShark's `dumpcap`

{{< code_expand >}}
dumpcap -i <hugo_red_highlight>network_interface(eth0 etc.)</hugo_red_highlight>
{{< /code_expand >}}

Anddddddd look what we got there, the **ARP** looking for where is `192.168.1.1`

![Packet 1](/images/blog/no-network-monitor-no-problem/packet1.webp)

![Packet 2](/images/blog/no-network-monitor-no-problem/packet2.webp)

This clearly indicated that my `/etc/network/interfaces` is likely -> `iface eth0 inet static`
and full configuration is likely like this

{{< code_expand >}}
iface <hugo_red_highlight>eth0</hugo_red_highlight> inet static
    address 192.168.1.100
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    . . .
{{< /code_expand >}}

This also explains why `Server-PC Ethernet` method doesn't work either, cause the Server **doesn't configured to accept DHCP** in the first place! 

and also that **local IP Address configured in the original `/etc/network/interfaces` is differ** from what the currently router is. Which is another contribution to the problem!

What we do next is simple, simply **assign `192.168.1.1` to our PC’s interface and set up routing**

{{< code_expand >}}
ip addr add 192.168.1.1 dev <hugo_red_highlight>eth0</hugo_red_highlight>
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev <hugo_red_highlight>eth0</hugo_red_highlight>
{{< /code_expand >}}

### And it's work!!

## DHCP

Now that I sucessfully restore access to my server, but what if `/etc/network/interfaces` is configured to only accept DHCP?

{{< code_expand >}}
iface <hugo_red_highlight>eth0</hugo_red_highlight> inet dhcp
{{< /code_expand >}}

This is more complex than the Static one but let's see how DHCP works from a graphics below:

![DHCP Protocol](/images/blog/no-network-monitor-no-problem/dhcp.webp)

This meant that the Server would annonce the `DHCP Discovery` on the interface Port 67, and what we need to do is to simulate the DHCP server as it's simpler than setting up the actual DHCP server on your server so...

After some researching and ~~GPTing~~ I managed to came up with Python script that recreate DHCP packet on our PC side [Here](https://owu.se/p-p/minoplhy/codes/src/branch/main/no-network-monitor-no-problem/dhcp.py)

The script setup IP Address as `192.168.1.123`, gateway `192.168.1.1`

The script flow is it **listen on UDP port 67 68** and do as the graphics upper describe, Server **announce `DHCP Discovery` on Port 67**, Python **resonse with `DHCP Offer`**, then **Server response with `DHCP Request`** and Python **Response with `DHCP ACK`**...end of the flow

Now Server will **configured whatever IP we set in the script as its IP Address**. Now what we gonna do is the same as Static one, add IP then setup routing

{{< code_expand >}}
ip addr add 192.168.1.1 dev <hugo_red_highlight>network_interface(eth0 etc.)</hugo_red_highlight>
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev <hugo_red_highlight>network_interface(eth0 etc.)</hugo_red_highlight>
{{< /code_expand >}}

And it's working!!!

# If detect nothing at all on WireShark?

You're cooked mate, you server probably shitbed bad

just buy a monitor
