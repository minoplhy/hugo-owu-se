Hello, I wrote this blog just to check if my script is working. Let's short this thing. I'm back to self-hosting now! 

<br>since VM collapsed on August, 2021, I moved a lot of service to Free Hosting like Netlify, GitHub Pages and now I'm back to this thing.<br>

This time, I think things will be more stable from now on and possibly not face the same fate as the old Blog and Gitea Server.

I Hope
