From the first Crappy Blog with WriteFreely, Ghost and ends here with Simple Jekyll.
And I'm kinda Proud to say that this refined Jekyll Page will be the v4 Version of Jekyll.

### Why v4 still being Jekyll?
Jekyll consumes low resources, compared to WriteFreely Drupal and Ghost.
And the important reasons Jekyll is kinda challenge to setup for a new comer like me.

### Point of marking refined Jekyll Page as v4
Point of refining Jekyll Page because I want to merge most of my Public Access things (Homepage, Blog, Gitea) to the same subdomain (1w1.one) and using subpath to all these things. So I rewrite the Homepage and try to merge them with Blog.

### why refine?
speak directly, Crappy's Blog Jekyll code is fucked up, since Jun 2021 and being like that until now!

### Why need Blog when you write a useless Blog once a Year?
it's a trend.
